## What is docker?
- container technology
- tool for managing continers
	- a standardized unit of software/code
		- holds the code/dependecies
	- eg. picnic basket with cutlery and food included
	- always the same results on run
- built in support in modern OS

## Why containers?
- standardizes dev & Prod environments , tools, dependencies

### VM vs DOCKER CONTAINERS
Virtual machines
	- has its own OS
	- lives on your own OS
	- high overhead
		- cause its essentially a standalone machine
	- redundant duplication
	- long boot times
	- reproducing is tricky

Docker
	- os built in / Emulated container support
	- Docker Engine
	- less overhead
	- install only what we need
	- lightweight OS
	- sharing / distribution is easy to do
